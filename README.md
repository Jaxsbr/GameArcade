# Game Arcade

Welcome to the Arcade Game Carousel repository!

Here you will find a collection of playable classic arcade games, all hosted elsewhere but accessible from this carousel. Each game will be represented by a custom-designed arcade game console machine, which will have a unified look and feel, but with the ability to be themed per game.

To achieve this, each game console will have a set of neon strip lights of varying colors, which can be customized according to the game's theme. Additionally, each console will have predefined areas where theme styling can be applied, including the Console Header, Console Screen, Console Buttons, and Console Footer.

Please note that for some games, we may use an IFrame to host them within the arcade game console, while for others, we may redirect users to the game's own hosting platform.

We hope you enjoy playing these classic arcade games, and we invite you to try them all and see which one is your favorite!
